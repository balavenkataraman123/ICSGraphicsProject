#Pong game instructions

#1 Game modes

This game has two modes, a quick-match mode, and a regular mode. In the quick-match mode, the game concludes after exactly one minute (To increase the level of suspense, the timer is not shown). The player with the highest score after the time is up wins. In the regular match mode, the game can continue indefinitely and only ends when one player accumulates a lead of no less than five points over another player. The game needs to be restarted after it gets over.

#2. Basic game mechanics

Most aspects of this game work the same way as the classic “pong”, including the scoring, but this differs in two ways:
Power-ups: There are two power-ups,  power-ups of the player and of the ball. These are described in detail later.
Improved physics: The vertical velocity of a player’s paddle is transferred to the ball upon impact. This makes certain strategies more advantageous and increases the level of thrill.

In this game, a “turn” is defined as whenever the ball reaches the far left or right of the game panel: either, when a player scores or when a player hits the ball with their paddle.


#3. Player power-ups
Each player has two different power-ups: Sizeups, and speed boosts. Size ups double the size of the paddle, and speed boosts double its speed. These can prove useful in certain situations. 
At the end of the turn the power-up was used (defined in section 2), the power ups of both players are cleared.
Each user is only given a limited number of these at the start of the game (3 of each).
An indicator at the bottom of the screen shows each player how many of each power-up they have left.
#4. Ball speed boost
Either player can choose to double the speed of the ball for the rest of the duration of a turn. After the ball speed boost has been used, it is locked out for one turn after. It is available after the next turn has ended.

#5. Controls.
Player one, the paddle on the left, uses W for moving up, S for moving down, A to activate sizeup power up, and D to activate speed boost power up. Either player can press the spacebar to activate the ball speed boost.
